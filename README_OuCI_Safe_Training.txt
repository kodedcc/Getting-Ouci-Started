# OuCI – Safe ML Training Plan

This document outlines how the OuCI system uses general knowledge and math principles to safely train its visual simulation engine without copyright issues.

## Principles
- Only use general physics, chemistry, geometry, and logic.
- No copyrighted images, fonts, or data.
- All visuals are generated through code and pixel logic.

## Core Rules
1. Dot: Defined by (x, y)
2. Line: Drawn using slope (m) or direction vector
3. Shape: Defined by bounding pixel logic
4. Font: Built line-by-line using stroke math
5. Chemistry: Reactions represented as data-triggered color shifts
6. Color: RGB = functions of energy, data, time

## Example:
- Fire pixel = red if oxygen + fuel + time
- Sad pixel = blue if silence + cold
- Font 'A' = three line segments intersecting

This is digital therapy, simulation, and art — powered by math.
